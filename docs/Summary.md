# Modern Reinterpretation of Pang: Project Summary

## **Introduction**
This project is a modern reimagining of the classic arcade game Pang (also known as Buster Bros.). The goal is to retain the core bubble-popping mechanics while introducing modern visuals, controls, and gameplay elements to appeal to today’s audience. The game will be developed using Unity, leveraging its robust 2D tools and cross-platform capabilities.

## **Core Gameplay Mechanics**

### **Bubble Popping**
The primary objective is to pop bubbles that descend from the top of the screen. Players use a harpoon or projectile to split bubbles into smaller ones until they are small enough to pop completely. Key mechanics include:
- **Bubble Physics**: Bubbles bounce off walls and each other, creating dynamic movement.
- **Splitting**: Larger bubbles split into smaller ones when hit, requiring multiple shots to fully pop.
- **Growth**: Bubbles gradually grow larger over time, increasing the urgency to pop them.

### **Player Movement**
Players control a character that moves horizontally across the bottom of the screen. Movement is smooth and responsive, with options for keyboard, gamepad, or touch controls.

### **Scoring**
Points are awarded for popping bubbles, with bonuses for chaining pops or clearing the screen quickly. A combo multiplier increases with consecutive pops.
