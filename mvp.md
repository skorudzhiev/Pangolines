# Pang Reimagined: MVP Design Document

## **Summary**
This project is a modern reinterpretation of the classic arcade game Pang (Buster Bros.). The game retains the core bubble-popping mechanics while introducing updated visuals, controls, and features. Players control a character who must pop descending bubbles by splitting them into smaller ones until they disappear. The MVP focuses on delivering a polished single-player experience with basic gameplay mechanics and retro-inspired visuals.

## **Design Layout**

### **Gameplay**
- **Core Loop**: Players move horizontally across the screen, shooting projectiles to split and pop bubbles. Bubbles grow over time, increasing urgency.
- **Bubble Physics**: Bubbles bounce off walls and each other, creating dynamic movement.
- **Scoring**: Points are awarded for popping bubbles, with bonuses for combos and quick clears.

### **Visuals**
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Pixel art style with vibrant colors and smooth animations.
- **UI**: Minimalist design with a score display, lives counter, and pause button.

### **Audio**
- **Sound Effects**: Satisfying "pop" sounds for bubble destruction.
- **Music**: Dynamic background music that changes intensity based on gameplay.
