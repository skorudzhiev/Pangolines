# Game Development Prompts

## Prompt 1
**Final Vision**:
Develop a modern reinterpretation of the classic arcade game Pang, featuring core bubble-popping mechanics with a polished single-player experience, responsive controls, and retro-inspired visuals.

**Initial Foundational Step**:
Build a basic player-controlled character that moves horizontally across the screen, capable of firing projectiles vertically upwards. Create an environment containing bubbles that bounce realistically off walls.

## Prompt 2
**Fix**:
Ensure horizontal player movement is smooth and responsive, and projectiles consistently fire vertically upward with correct collision detection against bubbles.

**Build**:
Implement bubble splitting mechanics, allowing large bubbles to split into two smaller ones upon being hit by a projectile. Visually represent the bubble-splitting event clearly with appropriate animation.

## Prompt 3
**Fix**:
Validate bubble splitting mechanics to confirm that bubbles correctly split into smaller sizes, and smaller bubbles retain realistic physics (bounce and speed).

**Build**:
Introduce bubble growth mechanics, where bubbles gradually grow larger over time, visually representing increased urgency. Clearly display incremental growth with smooth scaling animations.

## Prompt 4
**Fix**:
Confirm bubble growth is consistent, incremental, visually smooth, and does not negatively affect bubble physics or collision accuracy.

**Build**:
Develop a scoring system awarding points per bubble popped, incorporating combo multipliers for consecutive pops within a short timeframe. Add a visible and responsive score display and combo indicator on the UI.

## Prompt 5
**Fix**:
Check that scoring mechanics accurately reflect the intended rules, clearly displaying and updating scores and combo multipliers in real-time without lag.

**Build**:
Design and integrate two initial gameplay levels, each demonstrating increasing difficulty with varied bubble sizes, speeds, and arrangements. Allow players to progress between levels seamlessly and visibly communicate level transitions.
